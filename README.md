# Werewolf Unity Game
Welcome to the Werewolf github repo, whether you want to see the code or volunteer some changes, you are welcome. The following README explains how to get the project setup and start doing commits

## What is this game?
Ok, you probably don't know what this game is about, so here's a brief description. Video game based about the social party game, [Werewolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)) (Ok it says mafia but imagine that with werewolf, that's what we're doing here)

# How to Contribute
So there is many ways to contribute, so I will list the ways below.
## Art
To contribute with art, just create the art. If you're wondering which I'll accept, it's pixel art, I would like it to be simple, but not too simple, so for like the villagers, maybe stick to like 32x32 or something like that. When you're finished, just drop the files in the "Assets" folder. ⚠NOTE⚠ Please only enter sprite sheets or raw assets into the folder, no gif of the animation if preferable.
## The game itself
If you want to contribute with the game itself, just make sure to:
1. Make a discussion on what you plan to do, and update it for when you are done
2. Clone the repo using GitHub Desktop, open the project in Unity 6.1 and do you're work.
3. COMMIT CHANGES TO THE BETA BRANCH. Besides you can't commit to the main one anyway, but make sure to commit to beta just in case.

## Sounds
And finally, contributing with sounds, simple. Just make the sounds, and commit to assets folder.
